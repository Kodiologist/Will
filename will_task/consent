<h2>Purpose</h2>

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>If you decide to be in this study, you'll read a description of a hypothetical sexual situation and answer some questions. Questions will concern the situation as well as more general topics. You may also be asked demographic questions. There may be multiple conditions to which you could be assigned. If so, you'll be assigned to your condition randomly (by chance).
